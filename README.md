==========

`GoCxx` is (a still experimental) tool to automatically generate `Go`
bindings from any `C/C++` library using GCC-XML informations.

Eventually, its plugin system should allow to support the generation
of `Go` bindings from various sources (`CLang`, `SWIG-XML`, ...).
Its plugin system should also allow to generate bindings for other
languages than just `Go`.

For the moment, only the generation of `Go` code for the `gc` is
supported.
